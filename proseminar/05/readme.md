# Assignment 5

The goal of this assignment is to try some MPI debugging.

## Exercise 1 (3 Points)

### Tasks

- Take a look at the provided example codes.
- For each example code, run through the usual debugging workflow
    1) enable compiler warnings
    2) check with sanitizers
    3) run with a debugging tool of your choice (a working installation of MUST on LCC3 is provided in `/scratch/c703429/software/must-1.9.1`)
- Regardless of whether any of these steps highlights an issue, elaborate on the settings/parameters you used and what kind of errors they should detect!
- Report any bugs or issues that were found and attempt to fix them
- Is there anything else that can be done to highlight or avoid bugs?
- If you have time, use the same debugging workflow for one/some of your own implementations that exhibited strange behavior and see if you can spot any issues!
